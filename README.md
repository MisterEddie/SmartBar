# SmartBar
A smart power bar that monitors, controls, and reduces power consumption through manual and MongoDB Analytics

## Inspiration
Our team wanted to make a smart power bar device to tackle the challenge of phantom power consumption. 
Phantom power is the power consumed by devices when they are plugged in and idle, accounting for approximately 10% of a home’s power consumption. 
The best solution for this so far has been for users to unplug their devices after use. 
However, this method is extremely inconvenient for the consumer as there can be innumerable household devices that require being unplugged, such as charging devices for phones, laptops, vacuums, as well as TV’s, monitors, and kitchen appliances. 
We wanted to make a device that optimized convenience for the user while increasing electrical savings and reducing energy consumption.

## What It Does 
The device monitors power consumption and based on continual readings automatically shuts off power to idle devices. In addition to reducing phantom power consumption, the smart power bar monitors real-time energy consumption and provides graphical analytics to the user through MongoDB. The user is sent weekly power consumption update-emails, and notifications whenever the power is shut off to the smart power bar. It also has built-in safety features, to automatically cut power when devices draw a dangerous amount of current, or a manual emergency shut off button should the user determine their power consumption is too high.
